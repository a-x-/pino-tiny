# pino-tiny

a tiny little log formatter for [pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino).  

yeah, i know, [pino-colada](https://github.com/lrlna/pino-colada)...  

...but is does some weird black box stuff, and i did not like some of the formatting, and i was generally not too happy about certain things, so... 

i made pino-tiny!

## using it

pino-tiny is ran like any other pino output mangler, you run it as a process and pipe to it. first you need to install it.  it's really not meant to be a production log formatter, so prolly install it in your project as a dev-dependency.

```bash
npm i -D pino-tiny
--or--
yarn add --dev pino-tiny
```

...run it with your application that is already using [pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino) to log stuff...

```bash
$ node index.js | pino-tiny
```

...or put it in your `package.json` file...

```JSON
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon index.js | pino-tiny",
    ...
  }
}
```

## use it in code!

pino-tiny can be used in code too as a prettifier, if you want.  here is how you set it up:

```javascript
const { PinoTinyPrettifier } = require('pino-pretty')
const Pino = require('pino')

const logger = new Pino({
  prettifier: PinoTinyPrettifier(),
  prettyPrint: true
})

logger.trace('trace message')
logger.debug('debug message')
logger.info('info message')
logger.warn('warn message')
logger.error('error message')
logger.fatal('fatal message')
```

## what does pino-tiny do?

* shows log level, 3 characters (and not a emoji icon), color coded, and ??? for custom log levels.
* timestamps (no dates).  you know what day it is but millisecond timestamps give you some performance output
* strips all but the msg for output
* if there is are `res` and  `req` properties in the log data, it will put dimmed request and response info (method, url, status code).
* non-json string data that get piped in (like nodemon) get treated as info logs and outputted.
* does not swallow error messages
* non-pino JSON will be logged as dimmed stringified JSON

### New in v2.0

* programmatic prettifier
* better colors
* handle non-pino json
